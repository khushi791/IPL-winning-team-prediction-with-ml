## Overview                                      

The IPL Win Predictor is designed to provide real-time predictions for IPL match outcomes based on the current match situation. This project is deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring various match scenarios by adjusting customizable inputs.

## Features                                     

- **Real-Time Predictions**: Get live predictions for IPL match outcomes based on the current match situation.                                     
- **Interactive Interface**: The predictor is deployed on Streamlit, offering a user-friendly interface for exploring match scenarios.                                     
- **Customizable Inputs**: Adjust the match parameters and teams to simulate different match scenarios.                                     
- **Deployment**: Hosted on Streamlit Cloud for easy access and sharing.                                     

## Usage                                     

To make predictions, provide the following parameters:                                     

- **Batting Team**: The team currently at bat.                                     
- **Bowling Team**: The team currently bowling.                                     
- **City**: The location of the match.                                     
- **Current Runs**: The current score of the batting team.                                     
- **Overs Completed**: The number of overs completed.                                     
- **Wickets**: The number of wickets lost.                                     
- **Target Runs**: The total runs scored by the bowling team.                                     

The predictor will calculate the probability of the batting team winning based on these parameters and the current match situation.
